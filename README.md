## About

This is the 2024 edition of my personal website, [kobutra.com](http://kobutra.com). It's a single pager that serves as an extension of my LinkedIn profile, adding a bit more personality and flair. I redesign and redeploy this site almost yearly to keep it fresh and up-to-date.

## Usage

You can customize the content of your personal website by editing the files in the `pages` and `components` directories.

## Credits

I would like to extend my gratitude to the following individuals for their incredible React components that significantly enhanced the UI of this website:

- Manu Arora (Aceternity UI) - [@mannupaaji](https://x.com/mannupaaji)
- Dillion (Magic UI) - [@dillionverma](https://x.com/dillionverma)

Their work on Aceternity UI and Magic UI has been instrumental in achieving the beautiful and functional design of this site.
